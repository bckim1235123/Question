Im trying for linetracing for IR sensor and Loadcell for measuring weight. and display weight at LCD(128*64 for arduino)

but im experience hard for delay

i try to know why serial communication delay so i know that because of LCD 128*64

In my code

"Because of this line below
/*
void draw() "

that is my problem. i think that makes delay for IR sensor, UltraSonic Value

how can i solve this problem ?
